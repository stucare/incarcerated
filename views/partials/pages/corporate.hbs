        <p>Incarcerated offers the best experiences for team building and corporate events. We can host a huge 31 guests per hour across unique and challenging 5 rooms (From November 2018 we will be able to host 37 guests per hour), including an exciting 12 player head to head game where 2 teams of 6 go against each other. </p>
        <p>We can also organise for Managers and Supervisors to join our Game Masters, so they can view how groups are getting on, this is an amazing way to really observe your team in a challenging environment. It gives a unique insight to how your staff work under pressure and how they perform as a team.</p>
        <p>Escape rooms are fantastic for team building as they provide a level playing ground, a wide range of skills are required to complete the rooms in time. On many occasions we have witnessed first hand the quietest member of the team suddenly come out of their shell to provide vital details to help a team complete a challenge.</p>
        <p>We can cater to most sizes and we will always work to try and accommodate any special requirements you may have. Please speak to a member of staff when booking and they will be happy to help.</p>
